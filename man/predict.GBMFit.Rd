\usage{
\method{predict}{GBMFit}(object, newdata, n.trees, type = "link", single.tree = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class inheriting from \code{GBMFit}.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame of observations for which to make
predictions}

\item{n.trees}{Number of trees used in the prediction. If
\code{n.trees} is a vector, predictions are returned for each
iteration specified.}

\item{type}{The scale on which gbm makes the predictions}

\item{single.tree}{If \code{single.tree=TRUE} then \code{gbm_predict}
returns only the predictions from tree(s) \code{n.trees}}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of predictions. By default the predictions
are on the scale of f(x). For example, for the Bernoulli loss the
returned value is on the log odds scale, poisson loss on the log
scale, and coxph is on the log hazard scale.

If \code{type="response"} then \code{gbmt} converts back to the same scale as
the outcome. Currently the only effect this will have is returning
probabilities for bernoulli and expected counts for poisson. For the other
distributions "response" and "link" return the same.

\description{
Predicted values based on a generalized boosted model object - from
gbmt
}
\details{
\code{predict.GBMFit} produces predicted values for each
observation in a new dataset \code{newdata} using the first
\code{num_trees} iterations of the boosting sequence. If
\code{num_trees} is a vector than the result is a matrix with each
column representing the predictions from gbm models with
\code{num_trees[1]} iterations, \code{num_trees[2]} iterations, and
so on.

The predictions from \code{gbmt} do not include the offset
term. The user may add the value of the offset to the predicted
value if desired.

If \code{gbm_fit_obj} was fit using \code{\link{gbmt}}, there will
be no \code{Terms} component. Therefore, the user has greater
responsibility to make sure that \code{newdata} is of the same
format (order and number of variables) as the one originally used
to fit the model.
