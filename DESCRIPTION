Description: This package implements extensions
  to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's
  gradient boosting machine. Includes regression methods for least
  squares, absolute loss, t-distribution loss,
  quantile regression, logistic, multinomial logistic, Poisson,
  Cox proportional hazards partial likelihood, AdaBoost
  exponential loss, Huberized hinge loss,
  and Learning to Rank measures (LambdaMart).
