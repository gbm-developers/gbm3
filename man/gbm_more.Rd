\title{Perform additional boosting}
\usage{
gbm_more(gbm_fit_obj, num_new_trees=100, data=NULL, weights=NULL, offset=NULL,
 is_verbose=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbm_fit_obj}{a \code{GBMFit} object produced using \code{\link{gbmt}}. 
This object describes the boosted model on which to perform additional boosting.}

\item{num_new_trees}{a positive integer specifying how many additional 
iterations to perform.  This has a default value of \code{100}.}

\item{data}{a \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} containing the new values for the 
predictor and response variables for the additional iterations.  The names of the
variables must match those appearing in the original fit 
(as well as the number of rows), and this value defaults to \code{NULL}.
With a value of \code{NULL} the original data may be used for the additional boosting,
if no original or new data is specified an error will be thrown.}

\item{weights}{an atomic vector of doubles specifying the importance of each row of
the \code{data} in the additional iterations. If the previous data used is
kept within \code{gbm_fit_obj}; then the weights are extracted from the
 stored \code{GBMData} object.}

\item{offset}{an atomic vector of doubls specifying the offset for each response
value in the data used for additional boosting.}

\item{is_verbose}{a logical specifying whether or not the additional fitting should 
run "noisely" with feedback on progress provided to the user.}
}
\value{
the input \code{GBMFit} object with additional iterations provided for the fit.

\description{
Method to perform additional boosting using a \code{GBMFit} object - does not support
further cross validation.
