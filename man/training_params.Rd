\usage{
training_params(num_trees=100, interaction_depth=1,
 min_num_obs_in_node=10, shrinkage=0.001, bag_fraction=0.5,
 num_train=(2*min_num_obs_in_node+1)/bag_fraction + 1,
 id=seq_len(num_train), num_features=1)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_trees}{Number of trees used in the fit.}

\item{interaction_depth}{Maximum depth of each tree}

\item{min_num_obs_in_node}{Minimum number of observations each
node in a tree must have.}

\item{shrinkage}{shrinkage parameter applied to each tree in the expansion. 
Also known as the learning rate or step-size reduction.}

\item{bag_fraction}{fraction of independent training observations selected to
create the next tree in the expansion.  Introduces randomness in the model fit; 
if bag_fraction < 1 then running the same model twice  will result in similar
but different fits.}

\item{num_train}{number of obs of data used in training the model.
This defaults to the minimum number of  observations allowed - 
\code{(2*min_num_obs_in_node + 1)/bag_fraction + 1}.}

\item{id}{optional vector of integers, specifying which rows in the data correspond
to which observations. Individual observations may have many rows of data associated
with them. This defaults to \code{seq_len(num_train)}. 
NB: When calling \code{\link{gbmt}} or \code{\link{gbmt_fit}} the id should be the default.}

\item{num_features}{number of random features/columns to use in training model. 
This defaults to \code{1}.}
