\title{Generalized Boosted Regression Model Object}
\value{
\item{initF}{the "intercept" term, the initial predicted value to
which trees make adjustments} 
\item{fit}{a vector containing the fitted
values on the scale of regression function (e.g. log-odds scale for
bernoulli, log scale for poisson)} 
\item{train.error}{a vector of length
equal to the number of fitted trees containing the value of the loss
function for each boosting iteration evaluated on the training data}
\item{valid.error}{a vector of length equal to the number of fitted trees
containing the value of the loss function for each boosting iteration
evaluated on the validation data}
\item{cv_error}{if \code{cv_folds}<2 this
component is NULL. Otherwise, this component is a vector of length equal to
the number of fitted trees containing a cross-validated estimate of the loss
function for each boosting iteration}
\item{oobag.improve}{a vector of
length equal to the number of fitted trees containing an out-of-bag estimate
of the marginal reduction in the expected value of the loss function. The
out-of-bag estimate uses only the training data and is useful for estimating
the optimal number of boosting iterations. See \code{\link{gbm_perf}}}
\item{trees}{a list containing the tree structures. The components are best
viewed using \code{\link{pretty_gbm_tree}}}
\item{c.splits}{a list of all
the categorical splits in the collection of trees. If the \code{trees[[i]]}
component of a \code{gbm} object describes a categorical split then the
splitting value will refer to a component of \code{c.splits}. That component
of \code{c.splits} will be a vector of length equal to the number of levels
in the categorical split variable. -1 indicates left, +1 indicates right,
and 0 indicates that the level was not present in the training data}
\item{cv_fitted}{If cross-validation was performed, the cross-validation
predicted values on the scale of the linear predictor. That is, the fitted
values from the ith CV-fold, for the model having been trained on the data
in all other folds.}

These are objects representing fitted \code{gbm}s.
