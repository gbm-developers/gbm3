\title{Print model summary}
\usage{
print.GBMFit(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a fitted generalized boosting object of class \code{GBMFit}.}

\item{\dots}{arguments passed to \code{print.default}.}
}
\description{
Display basic information about a \code{GBMFit} object.
}
\details{
Prints some information about the model object. In particular, this method
prints the call to \code{gbmt}, the type of loss function that was used,
and the total number of iterations.

If cross-validation was performed, the 'best' number of trees as estimated
by cross-validation error is displayed. If a test set was used, the 'best'
number of trees as estimated by the test set error is displayed.

The number of available predictors, and the number of those having non-zero
influence on predictions is given (which might be interesting in data mining
applications).

If bernoulli or adaboost was used, the confusion matrix and
prediction accuracy are printed (objects being allocated to the class with
highest probability for bernoulli). These classifications
are performed using the cross-validation fitted values.

If the 'distribution' was specified as gaussian, laplace, quantile or
t-distribution, a summary of the residuals is displayed.  The residuals are
the cross-validation residuals. Also, a pseudo R-squared value is displayed.
For Gaussian response, this is 1 - sum(r*r) / sum(z*z) where z = y -
mean(y). For the other distributions, this is 1 - (median(abs(r)) /
mad(y))^2, following the suggestion of Rousseeuw and Leroy (equation 3.11).
Note that this definition of a robust R-squared is contentious.
