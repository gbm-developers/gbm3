\title{Marginal plots of fitted gbm objects}
\usage{
plot(gbm_fit_obj, var_index = 1, num_trees = gbm_fit_obj$params$num_trees,
  continuous_resolution = 100, grid_levels = NULL, return_grid = FALSE,
  type = "link", ...)

\method{plot}{GBMFit}(gbm_fit_obj, var_index = 1,
  num_trees = gbm_fit_obj$params$num_trees, continuous_resolution = 100,
  grid_levels = NULL, return_grid = FALSE, type = "link", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbm_fit_obj}{a \code{GBMFit} object fitted using a call to \code{\link{gbm2}}}

\item{var_index}{a vector of indices or the names of the variables to plot. If
using indices, the variables are indexed in the same order that they appear
in the initial \code{gbm2} formula.  If \code{length(var_index)} is between 1 and
3 then \code{plot.gbm} produces the plots. Otherwise, \code{plot.GBMFit}
returns only the grid of evaluation points and their average predictions}

\item{num_trees}{the number of trees used to generate the plot. Only the first
\code{num_trees} trees will be used}

\item{continuous_resolution}{The number of equally space points at which to
evaluate continuous predictors}

\item{grid_levels}{A list containing the points at which to evaluate each
predictor in \code{var_index} (in the same order as \code{var_index}). For
continuous predictors this is usually a regular sequence of values within
the range of the variable. For categorical predictors, the points are the
levels of the factor. When \code{length(var_index)} is one, the values can be
provided directly, outside a list.  This is NULL by default and generated
automatically from the data, using \code{continuous_resolution} for
continuous predictors. Forcing the values can be useful to evaluate two
models on the same exact range}

\item{return_grid}{if \code{TRUE} then \code{plot.GBMFit} produces no graphics
and only returns the grid of evaluation points and their average
predictions. This is useful for customizing the graphics for special
variable types or for dimensions greater than 3}

\item{type}{the type of prediction to plot on the vertical axis. See
\code{predict.GBMFit}}

\item{\dots}{other arguments passed to the plot function}
}
\value{
Nothing unless \code{return_grid} is true then \code{plot.GBMFit}
produces no graphics and only returns the grid of evaluation points and
their average predictions.
}
\description{
Plots the marginal effect of the selected variables by "integrating" out the
other variables.
}
\details{
\code{plot.GBMFit} produces low dimensional projections of the
\code{\link{GBMFit}} object, see \code{\link{gbm2}}, by integrating out the variables 
not included in the \code{var_index} argument. The function selects a grid of points 
and uses the weighted tree traversal method described in Friedman (2001) to do the
integration. Based on the variable types included in the projection,
\code{plot.GBMFit} selects an appropriate display choosing amongst line plots,
contour plots, and \code{\link[lattice]{lattice}} plots. If the default
graphics are not sufficient the user may set \code{return.grid=TRUE}, store
the result of the function, and develop another graphic display more
appropriate to the particular example.
